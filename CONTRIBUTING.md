# Contributing to Erg

Beginners should read the instructions [here](https://github.com/erg-lang/erg/issues/31#issuecomment-1217505198).

## Documents

If you are thinking of contributing to Erg, or are interested in the internal structure of Erg, you can take a look at the documents under [doc/dev_guide](./doc/JA/dev_guide/) (currently only Japanese).

## Bug reports

If you find any behavior that you think is a bug in Erg, I would appreciate it if you would [report](https://github.com/erg-lang/erg/issues/new/choose) it. Please make sure that the same bug has not already been reported as an issue.

If you type `cargo run --features debug`, Erg will be built in debug mode. This mode may dump information that may be useful for investigating bugs. I would appreciate it if you could report error logs in this mode.

Also, the environment in which the bug occurred need not be reported if it is clear that the bug was not caused by the environment.

## Asking questions

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them on the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/zfAAUbgGr4).
