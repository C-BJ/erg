# Code of Conduct

## General

Respect others.

Do not say mean things or show contempt, even if there is a difference in skill.

Do not be aggressive in disagreements.

Do not deny any identity of the other person.

Do not post anything that is severely offensive to others.

Do not spam, fish or troll.

If you see someone who you think is violating this Code of Conduct, please contact the [administrator](mailto:moderation.erglang@gmail.com) immediately. We will take appropriate action.

## Development

Requests are always welcome, but please keep in mind that they will not always be accepted. Many issues have trade-offs.

Don't intercept issues that others have been assigned (Check assignees on GitHub). If it is considered too difficult for one person to handle it, we will call for more support.

Before proposing a new feature, consider whether that feature could be easily solved by combining existing features.

Please write code in a style that is standardized by the Erg team and languages.
