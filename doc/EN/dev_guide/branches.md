# Branch naming and operation policy

* Basically, development is done on a single `main` branch (monorepo development). Create a `feature-*` or `issue-*` branch only if it is difficult to work without a separate branch.

## main

* main development branch
* The following conditions must be met

* compile successfully

## beta (not created at this time)

* Latest beta release
* The following conditions must be met

* Compile succeeds.
* all tests succeed

## feature-*

* A branch that develops one specific feature.
* main is cut off and created.

* No conditions

## issue-*

* branch that resolves a specific issue

* no condition
