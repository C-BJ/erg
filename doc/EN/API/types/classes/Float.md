# Float size

A type that represents real numbers (numbers with decimals). Represents an IEEE 754 compliant floating-point number and is the general equivalent of float in other languages.
The size of Float size is 8(1byte)~128(16byte). A simple Float represents `Float 64`.
0.1 in Erg actually belongs to the Ratio type, not the Float type. There is no Float type literal, it is generated by `(Ratio object)f64` (e.g. (1/2)f64, 15f64). f64 corresponds to the real number 1.
