# Visibility

Erg variables have the concept of __visibility__.
All the variables we've seen so far are called __private variables__. This is an externally invisible variable.
For example, a private variable defined in the `foo` module cannot be referenced by another module.

```python
# foo.er
x = "this is an invisible variable"
```

```python,compile_fail
# bar.er
foo = import "foo"
foo.x # AttributeError: Module 'foo' has no attribute 'x' ('x' is private)
```

On the other hand, there are also __public variables__, which can be referenced from the outside.
Public variables are defined with `.`.

```python
# foo.er
.x = "this is a visible variable"
```

```python,checker_ignore
# bar.er
foo = import "foo"
assert foo.x == "this is a visible variable"
```

You don't need to add anything to private variables, but you can also add `::` or `self::` (`Self::` for types etc.) to indicate that they are private. increase. It can also be `module::` if it is a module.

```python
::x = "this is an invisible variable"
assert ::x == x
assert self ::x == ::x
assert module::x == ::x
```

In the context of purely sequential execution, private variables are almost synonymous with local variables. It can be referenced from the inner scope.

```python
::x = "this is a private variable"
y =
    x + 1 # exactly module::x
```

By using `::`, you can distinguish variables with the same name within the scope.
Specify the scope of the variable you want to refer to on the left. Specify `module` for the top level.
If not specified, the innermost variable is referenced as usual.

```python
::x = 0
assert x == 0
y =
    ::x = 1
    assert x == 1
    z =
        ::x = 2
        assert ::x == 2
        assert z::x == 2
        assert y::x == 1
        assert module::x == 0
```

In the anonymous subroutine scope, `self` specifies its own scope.

```python
x = 0
f = x ->
    log module::x, self::x
f1# 0 1
```

`::` is also responsible for accessing private instance attributes.

```python
x = 0
C = Class {x = Int}
C.
    # Top-level x is referenced (warning to use module::x)
    f1 self = x
    # instance attribute x is referenced
    f2 self = self::x
```

## Visibility in external modules

A class defined in one module can actually define methods from an external module.

```python
# foo.er
.Foo = Class()
```

```python
# bar.er
{Foo;} = import "foo"

Foo::
    private self = pass
Foo.
    public self = self::private()
```

```python,compile_fail
.f() =
    foo = Foo.new()
    foo.public()
    foo::private() # AttributeError
```

However, both of those methods are only available within that module.
Private methods defined externally are visible to methods of the `Foo` class only within the defining module.
Public methods are exposed outside the class, but not outside the module.

```python,compile_fail
# baz.er
{Foo;} = import "foo"

foo = Foo.new()
foo.public() # AttributeError: 'Foo' has no attribute 'public' ('public' is defined in module 'bar')
```

Also, methods cannot be defined in the type to be re-exported.
This is to avoid confusion about methods being found or not found depending on the module they are imported from.

```python,compile_fail
# bar.er
{.Foo;} = import "foo"

.Foo::
    private self = pass # Error
Foo.
    public self = self::private() # Error
```

If you want to do something like this, define a [patch](./type/07_patch.md).

```python
# bar.er
{Foo;} = import "foo"

FooImpl = Patch Foo
FooImpl :=:
    private self = pass
Foo Impl.
    public self = self::private()
```

```python
# baz.er
{Foo;} = import "foo"
{FooImpl;} = import "bar"

foo = Foo.new()
foo.public()
```

## restricted public variables

Variable visibility is not limited to complete public/private.
You can also publish with restrictions.

Add `.[]` and specify "the identifier of a namespace [<sup id="f1">1</sup>](#1) you want allow accessing" in it.
In the example below, `.[.record]` is only exposed within the `.record` namespace, and `.[module]` is only exposed within the module.

```python,checker_ignore
# foo.er
.record = {
    .a = {
        .[.record]x = 0
        .[module]y = 0
        .z = 0
    }
    _ = .a.x # OK
    _ = .a.y # OK
    _ = .a.z # OK
}

func x =
    _ = .record.a.x # VisibilityError
    _ = .record.a.y # OK
    _ = .record.a.z # OK
    None

_ = .record.a.x # VisibilityError
_ = .record.a.y # OK
_ = .record.a.z # OK
```

```python,checker_ignore
foo = import "foo"
_ = foo.record.a.x # VisibilityError
_ = foo.record.a.y # VisibilityError
_ = foo.record.a.z # OK
```

Multiple namespaces can be specified by separating them with commas.

```python,checker_ignore
.[.record, func]x = 0
```

By the way, private attributes of a class are not accessible to subclasses.

```python,compile_fail
C = Class {i = Int}

D = Inherit C
D.
    f self = self::i # VisibilityError
```

If you want to be able to access from some subclass, specify as follows.

```python
C = Class {.[D]i = Int}

D = Inherit C
D.
    f self = self.i
```

If you want to expose it to all subclasses, use `.[<:Self]`.
This is the equivalent of `protected` in other languages.

```python
C = Class {.[<: C]i = Int}
```

<span id="1" style="font-size:x-small"><sup>1</sup> In Erg, a namespace refers to a set of correspondences between names and objects. Modules, functions, classes, records, and the identifiers of instant scopes are equated with namespaces. Since records, classes, and functions can be created without binding them to identifiers, they essentially create an anonymous namespace. However, when bound to an identifier, it is overwritten with the same name as the identifier. [â†©](#f1) </span>
